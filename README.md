# React Basics App

This is the working app students build from [React Basics](https://github.com/bjssacademy/react-basics) tutorial.

It uses Vite as the build tool and React as the JS library.

Clone the repo and run `npm install`

To run the site, use `npm run dev`

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
